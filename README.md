# Data

Sunspots.csv contains the mean monthly sunspot activity from 1749 to July 2018

# EDA

Performed basic exploratory data analysis to uncover trends with sunspots

# Modeling

The modeling files are broken up into:

1. [Linear regression and decision trees](https://github.com/amandakonet/sunspots-prediction/blob/main/modeling/time_series_lr_decision_trees.ipynb)
2. [Random forests and gradient boosting](https://github.com/amandakonet/sunspots-prediction/blob/main/modeling/time-series-rf-gb.ipynb)
